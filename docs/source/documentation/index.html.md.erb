# LAA Civil Applications Data Store

This is planned to be the central store of applications for Civil Legal Aid.

It is planned for applications to originate from [Check if you can get Legal Aid](https://checklegalaid.service.gov.uk/) and [Check if your client qualifies for legal aid](https://check-your-client-qualifies-for-legal-aid.service.gov.uk/).


## API Documentation

Base URL:

```
www.civil-case-api.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/
```

### Authentication

To use the API you will need a JSON Web Token (JWT) which can be obtained from the `/token` endpoint.

You will need to send a `POST` request with the following headers:

```json
{
    "accept": "application/json",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
}
```

and body:

```json
 {
    "grant_type": "password",
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string",
    "scope": "",
    "client_id": "string",
    "client_secret": "string"
  }
```

The `/token` endpoint generates the required access token to allow a user to access the service. When submitting other requests, the request needs to contain this authorisation bearer token.

All access tokens are valid for 30 minutes on the API.
