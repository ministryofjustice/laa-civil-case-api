# LAA Civil Applications Data Store

**This API and documentation are in early development.**

This is planned to the be central store of eligibility checks from [Check if your client qualifies for legal aid](https://check-your-client-qualifies-for-legal-aid.service.gov.uk/) and civil legal advice cases from the [Civil Legal Advice](https://www.gov.uk/check-legal-aid) call centre.

This API exists as a datastore allowing these resources to be stored and updated by the above services.

In the future this will allow these resources to be accessed throughout the users legal aid journey, reducing the need for users to re-answer questions and re-entry of data.
