# LAA Civil Applications Data Store

**This API and documentation are in early development.**

This is planned to the be central store of eligibility checks from [Check if your client qualifies for legal aid](https://check-your-client-qualifies-for-legal-aid.service.gov.uk/) and civil legal advice cases from the [Civil Legal Advice](https://www.gov.uk/check-legal-aid) call centre.

This API exists as a datastore allowing these resources to be stored and updated by the above services.

In the future this will allow these resources to be accessed throughout the users legal aid journey, reducing the need for users to re-answer questions and re-entry of data.

## Responsibilities of this API
This API is responsible for storing and updating records, and for the data governance of these records.

This includes:

- Data security
- Data integrity
- Implementing data retention policies

This API is not responsible for the validity of the data, this is the responsibility of API users.


## Data structure
The following is the current data structure for resources accessible in the API.

## Support

This API is maintained by the Civil Legal Advice team.

If you require support please reach out to `#laa-cla-dev`

## Test Environments

We plan on supporting the following test environment, with endpoints which will mirror production.

```
laa-civil-case-api-uat.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/
```

To integrate with this environment you will require test credentials.

## Access

To use the API you will need a JSON Web Token (JWT) which can be obtained from the `/token` endpoint.

You will need to send a `POST` request with the following headers:

```json
{
    "accept": "application/json",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
}
```

and body:

```json
 {
    "grant_type": "password",
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string",
    "scope": "",
    "client_id": "string",
    "client_secret": "string"
  }
```

The `/token` endpoint generates the required access token to allow a user to access the service. When submitting other requests, the request needs to contain this authorisation bearer token.

All access tokens are valid for 30 minutes on the API.
