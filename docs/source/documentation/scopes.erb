## Scopes
There are four scopes which each correspond to a http method:
- create
- read
- update
- delete

Scopes are only assignable by the CLA team and you need to request which scopes you api requires as part of your account creation process

### Adding/updating user scopes
The following overwrites the current user scopes with the ones given
`python bin/manage.py user-scopes-add <username> --scope=create --scope=read --scope=update`

### Listing user scopes

`python bin/manage.py user-scopes-list <username>`

### List routes with scopes
To get a list of all the routes which includes their scopes do
`python bin/manage.py routes-list`
