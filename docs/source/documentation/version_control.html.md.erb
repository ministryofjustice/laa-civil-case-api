# API Versioning
Version control helps manage changes to an API without breaking existing integrations or disrupting users relying on older versions.
Version control in our API is done using URL versioning.

## URL Versioning
URL versioning involves specifying the version number in the endpoint url path. 
For example:
```
/v1/cases/{case_id}
```

Changes in version should be recorded in a version directory in app/routers with all the required routers.

New router versions should be defined in the init file of that version.
You will need to include each router in your version directory.

```
from fastapi import APIRouter
from . import case_information, security

router = APIRouter(prefix="/v1")
router.include_router(case_information.router)
router.include_router(security.router)
```
In the `main.py` file you will also need to include your new version router:

```
from .routers.v1 import router as v1_router

def create_app() -> FastAPI:
    app = FastAPI(**docs_config)
    app.include_router(v1_router)

    return app
```

This will establish a version route for your endpoint.
