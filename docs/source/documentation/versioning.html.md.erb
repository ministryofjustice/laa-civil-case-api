# API Versioning
Version control helps manage changes to an API without breaking existing integrations or disrupting users relying on older versions.
Version control in our API is done using URL versioning.

## URL Versioning
URL versioning involves specifying the version number in the endpoint url path. 
For example:
```
/v1/cases/{case_id}
```

All versioning is handled via the versioning.py file in the app. This creates custom endpoints based
on decorators. If no versions are specified, then the endpoint is not created.

The exception to this is the security endpoint which only has one version to prevent vulnerabilities.

Changes in version should be recorded on the required routers.

Routers can also include multiple version which will create an endpoint for each version, such as:

```
@version("1","2","3")
@router.get(
    "/{case_id}",
    tags=["cases"],
    response_model=CaseResponse,
    dependencies=[Security(get_current_active_user, scopes=[UserScopes.READ])],
)
```
Which will create the endpoints:

```
/v1/cases/{case_id}
/v2/cases/{case_id}
/v3/cases/{case_id}
```
