# LAA Civil Applications Data Store

This is planned to be the central store of applications for Civil Legal Aid.

It is planned for applications to originate from [Check if you can get Legal Aid](https://checklegalaid.service.gov.uk/) and [Check if your client qualifies for legal aid](https://check-your-client-qualifies-for-legal-aid.service.gov.uk/).
